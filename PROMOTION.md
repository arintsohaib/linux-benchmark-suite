**Title:** I built a one-command benchmark suite for Linux with GPU support - feedback welcome!

**Body:**
```
Hey everyone! 👋

I've been working on a benchmarking tool for Linux servers and wanted to share it with the community.

**What it does:**
- Runs CPU, Memory, Disk, and GPU benchmarks with a single command
- Auto-installs dependencies (sysbench, fio, stress-ng)
- Generates beautiful HTML reports with charts
- Supports Intel, AMD, and NVIDIA GPUs

**Quick start:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arintsohaib/linux-benchmark-suite.git
cd linux-benchmark-suite
sudo ./benchmark.sh --with-gpu
```

**Sample results on my test server:**
- CPU: 8,500+ events/sec (12-core i5)
- Disk: 14 GB/s read, 8 GB/s write
- IOPS: 3.5 million random 4K

GitHub: https://github.com/arintsohaib/linux-benchmark-suite

Would love any feedback or feature suggestions! 🙏

**Title:** Show HN: Linux Benchmark Suite – One-command CPU/Memory/Disk/GPU benchmarking

**URL:** https://github.com/arintsohaib/linux-benchmark-suite

**Comment (optional):**
```
Hi HN! I built this because I was tired of running multiple tools to benchmark my servers.

Key features:
- Single command: `sudo ./benchmark.sh`
- Auto-detects and tests GPUs (Intel, AMD, NVIDIA)
- Beautiful HTML reports with Chart.js visualizations
- JSON output for CI/CD integration

Built with bash + sysbench + fio + stress-ng. Feedback welcome!
